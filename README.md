The goal was to create a web page for the "Northside Youth Soccer League" that meet with the needs and wants of Tom Denton, the league's director.

This and the following projects done during the course are organized by tasks, each with set requisites and goals, that represent different instances of the development. You can browse these instances by switching the branches of the repository.
